## Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt Worthington. I currently serve as the Data Science Lead at [Longevity Partners](https://longevity-partners.com/us/?t=4&redirects=0). Before working on [ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance#:~:text=Environmental%2C%20social%2C%20and%20corporate%20governance%20(ESG)%2C%20also,which%20companies%20to%20invest%20in.) Data at Longevity, I most recently served as the Senior Project Manager for Data Initiatives at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. In addition to my professional work, I've advocated at the Texas Legislature for [improved](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/education/2022/12/01/texas-lawmakers-propose-changes-to-school-taxing-funding-systems/69689253007/) [school](https://www.expressnews.com/opinion/commentary/article/commentary-school-choice-initiatives-would-17832154.php) [funding](https://www.tpr.org/show/texas-matters/2017-11-10/texas-matters-a-right-to-an-education) and served on the boards of [the Del Valle Independent School District](http://dvisd.net), [the City of Austin Early Childhood Council](http://austintexas.gov/ecc), and [the Del Valle Community Coalition](https://www.delvallecommunitycoalition.com/about).

In previous lives, I was an analytics leader for a couple of nonprofits, a literacy intervention specialist, special education teacher, digital learning expert, and IT Coordinator in various public school and central office administration settings. With the lived experience of growing up poor in Texas, my work often explores the intersections of poverty, public health, public education, and opportunity. Outside of work, I love hanging with my family, our friends, our church community, getting outdoors, cooking, reading, podcasts, and going to Spurs games in San Antonio.

## Quick Facts ðŸ“‹

- ðŸ”­ **Most recently, I developed**: a comprehensive [data resource](http://www.ncfh.org/dashboard.html) that consolidated disparate data sources related to farm laborers into a single, easy-to-navigate interactive resource currently utilized by over 200 organizations from across the United States who directly support farm laborers. By design, the code is not public but am always happy to talk about using data in the public sector!
