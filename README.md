## Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt Worthington. Currently, I am the Senior Project Manager for Data Intitiatives at the LBJ School of Public Affairds at the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, I serve as a commission member for the City of Austinâ€™s Early Childhood Council.

In previous lives, I was an analytics leader for a couple of nonprofits, a literacy intervention specialist, special education teacher, digital learning expert, and IT Coordinator in various public school and central office administration settings. Having grown up in poverty and fatherless, my work often explores the intersections of poverty, public health, public education, and generally making society more equitable. Outside of work, I love hanging with my family, our friends, our church community, getting outdoors, cooking, reading, podcasts, and going to Spurs games in San Antonio.

## Quick Facts ðŸ“‹

- ðŸ”­ **Most recently, I worked on** a COVID-19 Tracker + Database for [Texas 2036](https://github.com/texas-2036). The tracker lives [here](https://texas2036.shinyapps.io/covid_tracker/) and [the code](https://github.com/texas-2036/covid_tracker) for this resource lives here. Texas Monthly was kind of enough to do [a brief write-up](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/new-texas-covid-19-tracker/) about what value this resource has added to the COVID-19 conversation in Texas.
- ðŸ’» **Iâ€™m currently learning** more R stuff (always more R stuff), python, javascript essentials, and d3.js.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently volunteering** my time to serve on the City of Austin's Early Childhood Council, where we explore ways to increase the affordability and availability of high-quality child care in the city. One of the ways I've helped with this work is by building [a modeling app](https://mrworthington.shinyapps.io/Funding_Tool/) that allows child development centers to explore ways of expanding the number of seats in their early childhood programs [through partnerships with a local school district and the United Way for Greater Austin](https://www.statesman.com/news/20190324/austin-district-united-way-will-pair-up-to-expand-pre-k-push).
